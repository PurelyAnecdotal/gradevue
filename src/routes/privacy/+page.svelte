					{brand} is designed to keep students' information private the entire time they use the service.
				</p>

				<p>
					When a student uses {brand}, their own device sends their username and password directly
					to the offical student portal, and the portal returns their student information directly
					to their device. {brand} servers do not receive or process any student information. All student
					information is stored and processed on-device.
				</p>

				<p>
					If you have questions or concerns about {brand}, please contact us at
					<a href="mailto:{email}" class="underline">{email}</a>.
